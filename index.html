        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>It's heartbreaking to watch a loved one become entangled in a pig butchering scam, losing their savings and emotional well-being to manipulators. Pig Nurture exists to offer a lifeline. We understand the helplessness families feel and provide a compassionate, strategic path toward reclaiming your family member.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our unique approach involves carefully intervening in the communication channel. With your consent and cooperation, we gain access to the device used for communication. We then clone the scammer's profile and contact information, effectively replacing them in your loved one's chat applications. From there, we continue the "relationship" benignly, slowly reducing contact and gently steering the conversation towards ending the interaction, all without raising the scammer's suspicion or causing further distress to your family member.</p>
